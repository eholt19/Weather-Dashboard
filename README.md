# Weather Dashboard

## Description

The Weather Dashboard is a full-stack application that allows users to search for any city and view current and 5-day weather forecasts. It uses the OpenWeather API to fetch real-time data and saves a searchable history of previous city lookups. The app is built with TypeScript on both the client and server, and is deployed via Render.
